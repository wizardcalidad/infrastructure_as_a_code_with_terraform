# Infrastructure as a Code with Terraform

This repo contains practice code from different books read, the readme.md will be updated with time as work progresses.

## Quick start

**Note**: The examples in the repository deploy resources into your AWS account. Although I have been using aws free tier.
[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), so it is not my responsibility if you are charged money for this.ðŸ˜€

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Set your AWS credentials as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
1. `cd` into one of the example folders.
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. After it's done deploying, the example will output URLs or IPs you can try out.
1. To clean up and delete all resources after you're done, run `terraform destroy`.
